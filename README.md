# Mart 380 - Project 4
## Generative Art
For this project I created a python script to generatively create art images and output them as a png file. The images are created by using two different math functions to draw and manipulate lines on a cartesian coordinate plane. There are two different drawImage methods that manipulate the lines drawn in different ways based off of the math formulas given.

The art images can be found in the output folder. There are 4 different types of projection outputs that I decided to create: Mollweide, Polar, Rectilinear, and Standard.

This program was looped through 13 times, twice. Once for the first drawImage method, then again for the second drawImage method
